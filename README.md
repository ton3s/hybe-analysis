# Documentation for Analyzing and Summarizing Trials with Sharly.ai

This document explains how to use the generated trial files from the `trials` folder to analyze, summarize, and ask questions using a website like [Sharly.ai](https://sharly.ai).

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js Installed**  
   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to run the script that generates the trial files.

2. **Generated Trial Files**  
   The provided script processes a `data.json` file and creates individual `.txt` files for each object in the `trials` folder.

## Generating Trial Files

To generate the trial files:

1. Place your `data.json` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node your-script.js
   ```
3. This will create `.txt` files for each object in the array, located in the `trials` folder.

## Using the Trial Files with Sharly.ai

Once the trial files are generated, you can analyze and summarize them using Sharly.ai:

1. **Access Sharly.ai**
   Visit [Sharly.ai](https://sharly.ai) in your web browser.

2. **Upload a Trial File**

   - Navigate to the `trials` folder.
   - Select a specific trial file (e.g., `trial-1.txt`) you want to analyze.
   - Drag and drop the file into Sharly.ai or use the upload option.

3. **Analyze and Summarize**

   - Sharly.ai will process the uploaded file.
   - You can review the summarized content and insights directly on the website.

4. **Ask Questions**
   - Use the interactive features of Sharly.ai to ask questions about the trial.
   - The platform will provide answers based on the content of the uploaded file.

## Example Use Case

1. You have a trial file named `trial-3.txt` that contains details about a specific experiment.
2. Upload the file to Sharly.ai.
3. Sharly.ai provides a summary of the trial, highlighting key points such as the objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
4. Ask questions like:
   - "What is the primary conclusion of this trial?"
   - "What methods were used in this trial?"
   - "Are there any identified limitations in this experiment?"

## Benefits of Using Sharly.ai

- **Automated Summaries:** Quickly understand the essence of your trial data.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Get answers to specific questions without manually reviewing the entire file.
- **Time-Saving:** Focus on insights and decision-making rather than data parsing.

For any issues with generating the files or using Sharly.ai, please contact the project maintainers or refer to Sharly.ai's support documentation.
